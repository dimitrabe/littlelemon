As the final project of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate, it is required to design and develop a web page for the Little Lemon restaurant in Chicago.

Starting with the user research, a persona was provided that was used to identify the main pain points. It became clear that an online reservation functionality was needed to satisfy the needs of Little Lemon's customers. The users also highlighted the need to select where to sit and to specify a special occassion that may required special support from the staff of the restaurant.

Before putting my ideas on paper, I reviewed the UX of some well-established competitors keeping in mind some dos and don'ts. The next step was to design the UX and the UI based on the above mentioned user needs as well as the requirements of the restaurant owners. I started ideating and making some sketches which was then reviewed and made to wireframes using Figma.

Then to achieve visual consistency and respect the unique visual identity of the Little Lemon, I used the provided style guide.

Combining the style guide and the wireframes, I continued with the mockups and the high-fidelity prototype.

After testing and making some improvements, I started coding!
